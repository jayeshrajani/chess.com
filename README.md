This Chess Game project is a web-based, real-time multiplayer chess application. It allows two players to play against each other with a responsive drag-and-drop interface for piece movement, using a rotating board for the black player. Spectators can also join to watch the game in progress. The tech stack includes HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), and JavaScript for the frontend, with Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io powering the backend. Chess.js is utilized for enforcing chess rules and game logic. This project demonstrates a robust integration of real-time communication and interactive gameplay in a browser environment.
